# Summary

<h6>Purpose</h6>
I needed a new badge holder for work, so I turned out a reproduction of a busted holder from a co-worker. The dimensions should allow for two cards (snugly) on one side, and one card on the other..
<br>
I recommend the "horizontal" print orientation as noted in the "Print Settings" section.
<br>
<h6>Changelog</h6>
<ul>
<li>v1.0: Initial Release</li>
<li>v1.2: Fixed some dimensional inaccuracies in the spacing of the card slot.</li>
<li>v1.3: Final fit of 1.2 was successful, but could be too snug if using materials with any contraction in the print. Added another .25 mm tolerance for the internal length.
<li>v1.4: Structural support added to the main body. I was a bit too aggressive in removing supports from a print and noticed a seam which could use some work (because, you see, I broke it).
<li>v1.5: Added back the missing tension strips on the back face of the model.
<li>v1.6: Fixed spacing on one set of the tabs.
</ul>
<br>

<blockquote>
Once I get a basic comfort level with Fusion 360, I'll add a model in which I will fillet all edges and round out the outer corners to soften out the pokey bits.

# Print Settings

Printer: Monoprice Select Mini v1
Rafts: Yes
Supports: Yes
Resolution: .1
Infill: 100

Notes: 
I've printed this in both orientations. Here's the basic rundown.
<br>
<h6>Vertical (narrow flat edge base):</h6>
I needed a brim to keep the thing from toppling after around 60% completion. The faces of the print are really nice at .1 thickness. Using "Lines" for the support type in Cura seemed to be the easiest removal after printing.
<br>
<h6>Horizontal (default "flat" orientation of the model):</h6>
Much better structural strength (based upon physical stress potential expected through everyday usage) than the vertical print. Though the fact that you're removing supports from one face means that it isn't as smooth as the other side. But then - it's gonna be behind an ID card anyway, eh?
