# Summary

A headphone stand. I designed it to suit a gamecom 788 gaming headset with a padded headband 40mm wide. The two parts should hold together without glue. If they're too tight file off the tops of the strips in the holes.

edit: A friend suggested the headphone stand could be LED lighted. I've added an updated base file "Base LED updated" which will allow a 10cm LED strip to be fit inside the base in a U shape. Other types of LEDs might work too. I've used a 0 infill transparent top part. There is not much ventilation so ensure any LEDs are low powered and do not generate too much heat. The updated base part can be used with or without LED lighting.
